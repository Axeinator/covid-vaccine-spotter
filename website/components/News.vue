      <strong>03/23/2021:</strong> Once again <strong>Walgreens</strong> has
      started blocking access, but I'm hoping the latest workarounds should
      restore Walgreens appointment availability (again). In the meantime, I
      have also added <strong>Centura Health</strong> appointments for Colorado
      users. Any feedback is welcome:

      coder and have interest in helping out on
      <a href="https://github.com/GUI/covid-vaccine-finder/issues">GitHub</a>,
      that would be dandy (although the code's still messy)!
